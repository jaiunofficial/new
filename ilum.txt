I wrote you a letter, but unfortunately, it got lost today. Here are the lines I had written in it:


My affection for you began in 9th, but at that time my shyness held me back from confessing my feelings for you. It took me years of suffering to gather all my courage and express what I feel for you, my pure love for you. I feared being turned down, but thank you for accepting me.

It's been almost a year and a half since we have been together. I remember every second spent with you, either if it's school or the places we've been. Also, I never said sorry for hurting you multiple times. I regret every doing that saddened you. Please forgive me. I am sorry for hurting you.

Again, thank you for accepting me, who was just an average boy or below your expectation. Thank you for being kind to me. Thank you for changing me and helping me make a better person.
